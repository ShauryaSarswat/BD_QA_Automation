Speaker 2: Ma'am Maam haan?
Speaker 1: <noise> Do you collaborate with any hospitals?
Speaker 2: Yes sir. We have a list of hospitals. Kafi sare hospitals hai jo hamare services use kar rahe hai and patients ko provide kar rahe hai basically. The patient has direct link with your WhatsApp and then you give her instructions. And what is the benefit to doctor? So basically hum jo referrals hote hai unko generate karte hai. And patient retention bahut accha hota hai because ek baar patient jab aapke paas aata hai toh aap consult dete hai but iske alawa patient ko diet ke liye, yoga ke liye bahar dhundhna hota hai. Nahi nahi, aapke hi jagah pe.
Speaker 1: How is certified yoga instructor? How is certified dietitian?
Speaker 2: So bahut saari cheezein hai jo hum provide kar rahe hai jaise diet, yoga, mental health wellness ke liye counselling, garbh sanskar session, physiotherapy session, lactation counseling, labor management, matlab kafi sari cheezein hai and price wise agar aap dekhe toh agar aap keval dietitian ko rakhte hai toh uska around 4-5000 hota hai. For 3 months it is 2500 including all the things. Isme diet, yoga, mental health and regular follow ups karte hai. Diet chart jo hai woh different patient ke hisab se banta hai.
Speaker 1: Follow ups bol rahe ho?
Speaker 2: Call pe patient se hamari jo team hai woh patient se follow up karti hai. Matlab diet chart mere paas jaata hai sir. They take care ki woh proper follow kar rahe hai ya nahi kar rahe hai. Plus ek chat support bhi hai. So basically patient ko kuch bhi non-medical doubt hota hai, diet se lekar yoga se related ki aisa hota hai na ki papaya kha sakte hai kya? Siriyal chal sakte hai kya? Toh yeh sari chats matlab queries poochne ke liye ek hamara WhatsApp chat support hai. Usme doubt. Usme doctor, doctor bhi hote hai, doctor ko pata rehta hai ki patient se kya pooch rahe aur woh kya jawab de rahe hai. But haan matlab woh doctor ko unke answers karne ki zarurat nahi hai. Because woh burden hum lena chah rahe hai, ki non medical support hum patients ko de rahe hai sir.
